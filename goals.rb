p "My goals for intro to programming is to learn as much code as possible. Since I am new to programming and have no previous experince with any programming languages I am excited to soak up as much information as I possibly can. Hopefully by the end of this class I will be proficient with ruby and any languages that we dive into. Also I hope to learn the ins and outs of the terminal and to be comfortable with its basic functions and uses."
