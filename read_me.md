This is all the work I have done for my Introduction to Programming class.
I have been learing Ruby to create a base before going into ruby on rails. 
All the files in this repository have been written by me and you can see my progression by looking at each iteration of the projects I have done.

The most advanced program I have written is blackjack 3. It shows my use of classes, methods, arrays, and variables.
